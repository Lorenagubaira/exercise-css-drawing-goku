# Drawing Son Goku using CSS
<!--endhide-->

It's amazing what you can achieve with CSS, you can create very detailed drawings that replicate almost the same things any images can do, and the best thing is that CSS files weight 90% less that traditional `.png` or `.jpeg` files.

## üå±  How to start this project

We recommend opening the `html boilerplate`, using a provisioning tool like [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-github-codespaces) (recommended) or [Gitpod](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-use-gitpod). Alternatively, you can [clone the GitHub repository](https://4geeks.com/how-to/github-clone-repository) on your local computer using the `git clone` command.

This is the repository you need to open or clone:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/html-hello
```

üí° Important: Remember to create a new repository, update the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and upload the code to your new repository using `add`, `commit` and `push`.
